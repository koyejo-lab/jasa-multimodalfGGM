## Data 

### Abstract 

The dataset consists of simulated and real data of EEG-fMRI. The simulated data along with data generation code is available. We provide generation codes for four types of simulated graph under 2 different noise models. We will provide a download link for a simulated dataset for these four types of graphs and with the sample size 100, and the dimension 50,100,150. 
The real data is available upon request. Since we do not own the original dataset of  concurrent measurements of EEG-fMRI, we kindly ask to send the request to the original authors referenced in the manuscript.
